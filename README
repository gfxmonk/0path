0path is a utility for adding the path to a zero-install feed to your current
environment, as well as the implementation's path. This is useful to experiment
with a library without writing your own (local) feed depending upon it.

This should not be used as a substitute for creating a zero-install feed with
your dependencies declared appropriately, but can be useful for trying out a
library without going to that effort.

INSTALLATION:
-------------

Because 0path modifies environment variables, the suggested method of
installation is to add this function to your shell's inisitalisation
environment (e.g by adding to ~/.bashrc):

    function 0path { eval `0launch 0path.xml "$@"` }

(for zsh users, you should remove the double quotes around "$@")

USAGE:
------

Then the usage is simply e.g:

    0path http://gfxmonk.net/dist/0install/autonose.xml PTYTHONPATH

This will cache and insert the cached path for autonose in PYTHONPATH, as
well as adding environment bindings for each library autonose depends on.

You can supply optional --insert and --mode options, which mimic the behaviour
of these attributes in a zero-install <environment> binding.

If you just want to run it as a once-off, you can run e.g:

eval `0launch 'http://gfxmonk.net/dist/0install/0path.xml' <interface> <environment_var>`
