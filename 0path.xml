0path is a utility for adding the path to a zero-install feed to your current
environment, as well as the implementation's path. This is useful to experiment
with a library without writing your own (local) feed depending upon it.

This should not be used as a substitute for creating a zero-install feed with
your dependencies declared appropriately, but can be useful for trying out a
library without going to that effort.

INSTALLATION:
-------------

Because 0path modifies environment variables, the suggested method of
installation is to add this function to your shell's inisitalisation
environment (e.g by adding to ~/.bashrc):

    function 0path { eval `0launch 'http://gfxmonk.net/dist/0install/0path.xml' &quot;$@&quot;` }

(for zsh users, you should remove the double quotes around &quot;$@&quot;)

USAGE:
------

Then the usage is simply e.g:

    0path http://gfxmonk.net/dist/0install/autonose.xml

or, if you need to add the feed's implementation to a specific environment
variable (rather than one it exports):

    0path http://gfxmonk.net/dist/0install/autonose.xml PTYTHONPATH

This will cache and insert the cached path for autonose and all dependencies
into their appropriate environment variables.

The result of which being that you can fire up your python interpreter and
just type `import autonose`.

If providing an environment variable name, you can supply optional --insert
and --mode options, which mimic the behaviour of these attributes in a
zero-install &lt;environment&gt; binding.

If you just want to run it as a once-off, you can run e.g:

eval `0launch 'http://gfxmonk.net/dist/0install/0path.xml' &lt;interface&gt; &lt;environment_var&gt;`
